    body: "<p>We're not just a magic idea whitepaper. You can build cutting edge distributed apps in JavaScript or Lisp on our platform right now! Your apps will have access to core services like: a customizable UI, the Holochain DPKI app that manages keys and identities across holochain applications,
	the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://holo.host\">Holo</a>
	 platform for serving crypto apps to normal web browsers, API bridges between crypto apps, and the capacity to migrate data when updating distributed apps.</p>
   <h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/team.html\">We're Hiring!</a></h3>
   <p>To develop Holochain applications you need to know about:</p>
   <ul><li>getting Holochain installed</li>
     <li>how to use the command line tools</li>
     <li>how to configure your application by creating a &quot;DNA&quot; file</li>
     <li>how to write your application code in JavaScript or Lisp</li>
     <li>how to think through building a distributed application</li>
     <li>how to build a user interface for your app</li>
     <li>how to test your application code</li>
