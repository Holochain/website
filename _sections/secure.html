    body: "<p>Every application runs its own holochain on its own terms, without the need for expensive hosting overhead. Since users are hosts, as more agents use an app, more hosting power and storage becomes available. The hosting load per user actually gets lighter.</p>
    <p>The first entry of each agent's source chain contain the app's “DNA”—the code that runs the app. This contains peer validation requirements ensuring that the application runs securely: that data cannot be counterfeited, tampered with, or lost. 
    Eash app stores its data in a validating DHT creating redundancy of public data across randomized nodes. When nodes go offline, the DHT is self-healing and rebalances the data to different nodes. And if someone alters their own app code they effectively fork themselves out of the shared DHT space into an entirely different application.</p>"
