<p>Build a distributed app prototype in a weekend!
Familiarize yourself with a new coding paradigm and learn tools for the rapid development of decentralized applications. Holochain is a post-blockchain protocol for storing data in a completely peer-2-peer network. Join co-founder Art Brock and members of the Holochain team at Bushwick Generator for a weekend workshop on using the technology. We're excited to be partnering with the <a href="https://twitter.com/bushxgenerator?lang=en" target="blank">@buchxgenerator</a> (twitter) and their community who regularly host <a href="https://bit.ly/2suJX28" target="blank">Decentralized Meetups</a> in the beautiful space.
