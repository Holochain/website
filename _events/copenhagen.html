  <h4>Makers, coders, designers and organizers.</h4>
  Brace yourself…. A Hackathon is coming.<br/>
  March 23-25th we’re gathering, deep in Hall of The Odd to dive into the distributed computational network Holochain. <br/>
  Learn about the post-blockchain technology Holochain by its founding team, and explore how you can harness this peer-to-peer network to make scalable, agent-centric tools that facilitate fluid & emergent collaboration.
