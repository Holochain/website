      <p>The Summer 2018 Holochain Internship Program has been a smashing success! We’re so thrilled by the great work being done by our six developer interns, who have quickly learned how to develop apps using Holochain, and have made meaningful contributions to our documentation. Several of these interns will be joining the Holo Team to continue Holo app development, and all of them will continue to develop using Holochain with their student groups or other companies.
      </p>
      <p>Because of the success of this program, we’re happy to announce that we’re opening applications for the next cohort of interns, who will participate in our internship program October 1 to December 8, 2018. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis and will close when we’ve selected our six participants.</p>
